### Overview
Getting around campus and the surrounding community can be confusing with the Blacksburg Transit Bus System. That's why our guide, designed with students in mind, offers a convenient, reliable, and step-by-step way to travel between residence halls, classrooms, and key off-campus destinations. In our guide, we will cover how to plan a trip, how to see routes, and additional details found on the website.

## Using the App
 The Blacksburg Transit app is available for download in the App store (iOS) and Google Play store (Android). The app is best to use if you are out and about and need a quick way to check the map, arrival times, etc. Because of the app's mobile usage, your location could impact the reach of internet services, and the app must connect to wifi or cellular data to work properly.

### Using the Map Feature
Open the app. You will see this page upon opening:


 <img src="https://github.com/allya21-bot/allya21-bot.github.io/blob/main/idkwhat.png?raw=true" alt="bus" width="500" height="1200">



 On the "Map" page, click the person icon on the bottom right of the screen, as shown below. 


 <img src="https://github.com/allya21-bot/allya21-bot.github.io/blob/main/littleperson.jpg?raw=true" alt="guy" width="500" height="500">

Pressing the person icon will show red dots on the map as shown above, these red dots are the stops nearest to your location. 

Pressing the red dots will show the stop number and how many feet the stop is from your current location.

#### Step 1: Find a stop near you
    
  Two options are available to find a stop that is closest to your location. 
  
The first option is to use your current location. 

1. You can do this by pressing the three black dots to the right of the **Your starting point** box. Pressing the three black dots will bring up a screen that says **From Location** at the top. 

2. Pressing **current location** will locate where your phone is positioned and use the closest stop to your location. 

The second option is to use the map from the step above to locate the stop nearest you. 

Pressing the three black dots will bring up a list of all of the stops. You can select a stop from this list or type your desired stop in the box labeled **Your starting point**. 


>[!NOTE]
>Location services will need to be turned on and the BT App must have access to your location.

#### Step 2: Finding your destination
  
  Next, you will need to plug in your destination where it says **Your destination.**
  
  To view all of the stops press the three black dots beside the box that says **Your destination.** 
  
You can select a stop from this list or type one into the box by typing the stop into the **Your destination** box.

    
#### Step 3: Selecting when to leave

In the section labeled **When:** you can choose what time you want to leave.

Three options are available: Leave Now, Leave At, and Arrive By

- **Leave Now** means you want to leave at the current time. 

- **Leave At** will bring up the date and time and you can put in when you want to leave. 

- **Arrive By** will bring up the date and time and you can put in when you want to arrive to the stop by. 

You can select from these options by pressing **Leave Now**.

#### Step 4: Selecting Priority
Selecting priority determines different ways you can arrive at your stop. 

Three Priority options are available based on what you find most important in your route: Quickest Route, Least Walking, and Fewest Transfers.

Quickest Route means that the route suggested will be the quickest way to get between your inputted stops, regardless of walking distance. 

Least Walking will show the route between your stops with the least amount of walking, even if this is not the fastest way. 

Fewest Transfers will show the route between your stops with the fewest bus transfers, even if this is not the fastest. 

You can select from these options by pressing **Quickest Route**. 

#### Step 5: Finding Trips 

Lastly, pressing **Find Trips** will show the starting point, ending point, total duration and distance, and steps for how to get to your desired stop. 

The **Find Trips** button will also bring up a map that shows your starting point, ending point, and the route between them. 

>[!NOTE]
You can also switch your starting point and your destination by pressing the shuffle button between the two boxes.

View the buses current location in relation to your stop by pressing on the stop name and number in the list. A text marker will pop up on the map above your stop.

Use two fingers on the map and slide them outward to zoom into the map. Find the bus icon on the map to see where along the route the bus is currently located. See where the bus is in relation to your stop.

## Using the Website

The [Blacksburg Transit website](https://ridebt.org/) provides users with information of routes and schedules of Blacksburg and the surrounding area, including downloadable maps and service calendars. The website also  explains the service levels (Full Service during most of the academic year, Reduced Service during breaks), with hours of operation and holiday closures. All of the aforementioned information is available on the app, but the website interface holds more, robust information.
